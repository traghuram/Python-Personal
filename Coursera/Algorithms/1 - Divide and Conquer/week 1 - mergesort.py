""" Mergesort - consists of a recursive steps that merge sorted sub-arrays of the input array.

Two versions of merge sort - first does merges by cutting array into half in each recursive call

Second version asks for the "split" amount

Both should take same amount of time since having fewer recursive calls means more merges
